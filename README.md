# Smart Door Authentication System on AWS

Project 02 of the Cloud Computing & Big Data Course at NYU taught by Prof. [Sambit Sahu](https://engineering.nyu.edu/sambit-sahu) 

The aim of the project is to implement a distributed authentication system providing access to a virtual door. 

The Authentication & Access system stores new visitor data, provides access to old visitors based on stored data and notifies owner to permit access.

Tools & AWS Services Used: [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/), [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
